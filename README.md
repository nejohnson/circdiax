# circdiax
A fork of Stefan Krause's circdia package for LaTeX with my own particular tweaks and modifcations.
Changes I have made:
- transistor, diode and capacitor bars are rectangular lines without rounded ends
- renamed files with 'x' to avoid confusing with Stefan's original work
- refactored electrolytic capacitors as a new base command, and with an open box for the anode.
- added ferritecore command for inductors (aerial coils, beads, etc).
- added alternate JFET symbols (gate junction in middle of bar).
